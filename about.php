            <h2>Designs and concepts</h2>
			<p>The salon interiors are inspired from abstract and defined lines; giving the salon a very modern, plush and stylish look. The inspiration for the salon interiors comes mostly from the needs expressed by the growing awareness and more informed consumers.While setting up the salon, faced typical challenges that come from a very fast growing and radically changing industry. With the consumers being more informed and aware; we had to ensure that we live to the perception of ultimate in luxury yet affordable as per mindset of customers. The latest yet the most modern and luxurious had to be sourced and none other than the best â€“ Tangy Rose was chosen." While setting and designing a new salon I put myself in place of the consumer and then feel and relate with before choosing or selecting.</p>
